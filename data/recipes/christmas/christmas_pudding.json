Put the grease-proof paper circle on top and fit tightly, then add a layer of aluminium foil. After this, take a square of pudding cloth and fasten it to the top using a twine loop around the lip of the bowl. Create a handle using two more lengths of twine.",

Steam for approximately 6 hours, then let it cool to room temperature and store in the pantry.",
